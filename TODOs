- The script to exist after RUN_AFTER_SUCCESS seconds, even when run from systemd.
- On start up there are some errors logged about readonly filesystem
```Aug 10 01:00:45 lab network_monitor.sh[1096]: tee: /var/log/network_startup_monitor.log: Read-only file system
Aug 10 01:00:45 lab network_monitor.sh[1096]: 2025-08-10 01:00:45.168 - =============================================================
Aug 10 01:00:45 lab network_monitor.sh[1100]: tee: /var/log/network_startup_monitor.log: Read-only file system
Aug 10 01:00:45 lab network_monitor.sh[1100]: 2025-08-10 01:00:45.174 -     NETWORK STARTUP MONITOR SERVICE - Sun Aug 10 01:00:45 AM BST 2025
``` 
presumably because the service is running before the filesystem is mounted read-write, can we hide these warnings.
- On start up, the script claims NetworkManager connectivity status is FULL . even though NetworkManager service is not yet running, do not consider NetworkManager connectivity full in that case.

Also the script report network services are not ready even though they are all still inactive, lets wait for them to be active
